"Redraw the subject shown in the attached image into a specific game asset style with precise framing and pose constraints. Make the image square.

Character Pose & Orientation Instructions:

The subject must be positioned in a full-body standing pose, facing directly forward.

The subject's eyes must be looking straight ahead at the 'camera'.

Art Style Instructions:

Convert the subject into a high-quality 2D game asset illustration.

Use clean, sharp vector line art with soft cel-shading and vibrant colors.

Layout & Framing Instructions:

The subject must be perfectly horizontally centered on the canvas.

Vertical Scaling is crucial: Scale the subject so that the highest point of the subject (e.g., top of head) is exactly 10% below the top edge of the image.

The lowest point of the subject (e.g., bottom of feet) must be exactly 10% above the bottom edge of the image.

The background should be a solid purple color."
